## The Basics

A Black Hole is a Celestial Object that has a very strong gravitational pull that not even light can escape.

This happens because Black Holes have an astronimically large mass.

The lowest-mass known black hole belongs to a binary system named XTE J1650-500. 

The black hole has about 3.8 times the mass of our sun.

## How do they form?

Black holes are formed when a massive star reaches the end of its life and implodes, collapsing in on itself.

Now you might be thinking our sun could become a black hole, but that is wrong.

It's way to small for that, The sun would have to be about 20 times as massive to become a black hole at the end of it's life.

## Different Parts of a Black Hole

This illustration of a black holes show us all the different parts.

The Singularity is the core of a black hole, this is where all the matter has collapsed into, making a tiny, infinitely dense point.

The Event Horizon is the part of the black hole that is actually black, if anything is at this point it will not be able to escape.

Relativistic jets are the jets of particles and radiation being produced when a black hole feeds on stars, gas or dust, this results in the jets of particles and radiation blasting out from the black holes poles at near light speed.
They can extend for thousands of light-years into space.

The Accretion disc is a disc of superheated gas and dust which whirls around a black hole at very fast speeds, producing electromagnetic radiation that reveal the black holes location.

The Innermost stable orbit is the inner edge of an accretion disc, it is the last point where an object can orbit safely without falling past the point of no return
