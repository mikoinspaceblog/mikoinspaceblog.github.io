A rocket stage test firing by Chinese commercial company Space Pioneer ended in catastrophic failure and a dramatic explosion Sunday.

Space Pioneer conducted a first stage engine test of the rocket Tianlong-3

[Amateur Footage](https://x.com/J1NFENG/status/1807334917031825869) captured by Gongyi citizens and posted on Chinese social media shows the nine-engine test stage igntiting and then, exceptionally, taking off.

Hold-down clamps and other structures are typically used to securely keep stages in place.

Thankfully, no one got hurt during this shocking accident.

Space Pioneer issued its [own statement](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6K2mdDWviOlk30oU-JH90Q) later, stating there was a structural failure at the connection between the rocket body and the test bench.

The rocketâ€™s onboard computer automatically shut down the engines and the rocket fell 1.5 kilometers southwest.

This launch site was the same site that had a [big catasthrophe on the 22nd of June](https://spacenews.com/china-launches-sino-french-astrophysics-satellite-debris-falls-over-populated-area/) (2024) where debris of a Chinese Satellite Mission fell over a populated area.
