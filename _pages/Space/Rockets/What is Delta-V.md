## What is it?

Delta-V (Δv) represents the maximum change in velocity a rocket can achieve. 

It is a measure of the rocket's capability to perform maneuvers such as launching, orbiting, or landing.

## Important

Delta-V (Δv) is crutial for any mission, since you need a certain amount of it to perform the mission, therefor it is calculated beforehand.0

## How to Calculate Delta-V (Δv)

The equation used to calcute Delta-V is:

Δv = vₑ * ln (m₀/mₜ)

in which vₑ is the exhaust Velocity, m₀ is the initial mass (e.g a fully fuled rocket) and mₜ being the final mass (e.g a half empty rocket)
